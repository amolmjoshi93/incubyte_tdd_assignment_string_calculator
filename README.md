# StringCalculator

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/string_calculator`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

Inside that you can simply run below code to test:

```bash
StringCalculator::Addition.perform('1,3,5,8')
```
